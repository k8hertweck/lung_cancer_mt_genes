## Figure 1: Expression graphs for all genes in LUAD

```{r}
fpkm_luad <- read_csv("TCGA-LUAD.csv")
```

Sample size: 

- normal, n = `r nrow(filter(fpkm_luad, shortLetterCode == "NT"))`
- tumor, n = `r nrow(filter(fpkm_luad, shortLetterCode == "TP"))`

### A. Genes not significantly different between tumor and normal

## Figure 2: Expression graphs for all genes in LUSC

```{r}
fpkm_lusc <- read_csv("TCGA-LUSC.csv")
```

Sample size: 

- normal, green (left), n = `r `nrow(filter(fpkm_lusc, shortLetterCode == "NT"))`
- tumor, purple (right), n = `r nrow(filter(fpkm_lusc, shortLetterCode == "TP"))`
